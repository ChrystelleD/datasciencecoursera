run_analysis.R: contains the script that performs the requirements of the assignment. I have commented each requirement where it is taken care of in the script.

A high level overview of what this script performs follows:

    Loads the train and test datasets into memory ('test' and 'train') from X_test.txt and X_train.txt
    Applies the variable names as detailed in 'features.txt' to both test and train datasets
    Filters only those columns that contain mean() and std() from both 'train' and 'test' dataset
    Loads the 'activity' rows for test and train datasets from y_test.txt and y_train.txt
    Applies the activity_labels.txt to the activity rows to convert the numerical values to character values which describe the activity
    Adds the translated activity column as the first variable in the 'test' and 'train' datasets respectively.
    Loads the subject data from subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt, and adds them to the 'train' and 'test' datasets as the first variable (i.e. before activity)
    Merges the 'train' and 'test' datasets together using a row-bind into a new dataset 'combined'
    Groups the combined data by subject and activity in the new dataset 'grouped'.
    NOTE: As the only change is to group the data, I have not created a separate codebook for this dataset.
    Creates a new tidy dataset called 'summary' which is the dataset represented by the output file 'tidy_dataset.txt'

tidy_dataset.txt: This is the output tidy dataset from requirement 5 - the independent, tidy dataset which summarizes the subjects, activities and average calculations for each activity measurement across the merged train and test datasets.
